# AEGIS — Instrument Console

AEGIS (formerly JARVIS) is a voice-driven AI assistant with a real system-control backend: it can chat, open apps, search and play music, and control your PC's power state (shutdown/restart/sleep/lock) — all through a local Python bridge.

There are two ways to run it, and they share the same code:

| Mode | Entry point | What works |
|---|---|---|
| **Local (full control)** | `python dev_server.py` → serves `aegis_standalone.html` | Everything: chat, wake-word voice, real power control, volume, YouTube search+play, live CPU/RAM/disk vitals. |
| **Hosted (chat-only)** | `npm run dev` locally, or deployed to Vercel → serves `index.html` | Chat and wake-word voice work standalone (talks to Groq directly, no bridge needed). PC-control panels (vitals, power, media) automatically hide themselves when no bridge is reachable — see **Chat-only mode** below. |

## Quick Start (full control, on this PC)

1. Install Python dependencies once:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the bridge:
   ```bash
   python dev_server.py
   ```
3. Open the local network address printed in the terminal (e.g. `http://aegis.local:5001`) — **not** a loopback host, that's blocked by policy. Click **INITIALIZE AEGIS**.
4. Open **⚙ Settings** (top right), paste a free Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com), click **Save**.

Say *"Aegis, lock my PC"* or click the shield icon to arm hands-free wake-word listening.

## Chat-only mode (Vercel / phone)

AEGIS is meant to run on your own PC for real PC control — that part can't exist on a hosted platform like Vercel, since there's nothing for it to control there. When no bridge is reachable, the app automatically drops into **chat-only mode**: the Vitals, Media, Power, System Log, and Active Tasks panels hide themselves, leaving just the presence dial, chat, and Quick Launch (which just opens URLs, no PC needed). A note at the bottom of the page confirms you're in this mode.

To deploy the chat-only build to Vercel:

```bash
npm install
vercel login      # one-time, opens a browser to authenticate
vercel --prod
```

`vercel.json` is already configured (`npm run build` → `dist/`, Vite framework preset). Once deployed, opening the Vercel URL from your phone gives you the chat/voice AI experience anywhere — just open Settings and paste your Groq key on that device too (the key lives in that browser's local storage, not on a server).

If you *do* want your phone to control your PC remotely, the bridge would need to be reachable from the phone — either the same Wi-Fi network (enter your PC's LAN address in Settings → Local Bridge URL), or a public tunnel (e.g. `ngrok http 5001`). That's a real exposure of local system control to the network, so only do it deliberately.

## Features

- **Real system control**: file management, app launch/close, browser open, and power control (shutdown/restart/sleep have a genuine, cancellable 10-second OS-level delay; lock is instant) — all via `dev_server.py`.
- **Wake-word voice**: arm the shield toggle for hands-free "Aegis, …" activation; the mic button is push-to-talk.
- **Spoken replies**: real browser text-to-speech, toggleable.
- **Music**: the `play_music` tool searches YouTube and plays it embedded, with real volume control.
- **Live vitals**: CPU, memory, and disk usage polled from the bridge every 5 seconds (local mode only).

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: self-contained HTML/CSS/JS, no framework or CDN dependencies at runtime (custom canvas-drawn presence dial, system fonts only). `aegis_standalone.html` (local) and `index.html` (hosted) both import their engine from `src/shared/` — one shared implementation, not two copies.
- **AI**: browser calls Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) directly — works with or without a bridge. Uses native Groq tool/function-calling (`src/shared/groqAgent.js` + `toolSchemas.js`/`toolExecutors.js`) to take real action, not text-parsed commands.
- **Bridge**: `dev_server.py`, Python stdlib `http.server` + `psutil`/`pycaw`/`comtypes` (Windows). Port `5001` by default.
- **Security policy**: loopback addresses are rejected everywhere by design — always use a real hostname or LAN IP.
